# work-sample
Thanks for your interest in my work.  

The work I've shared in this repository is not production grade code for system 
deployment.  It is mostly work-related projects, and sometimes
academic projects or things I've explored on my own.  For things like COVID,
I've left visualizations in their original form with real data.  For projects
involving work data, information has been de-identified or sometimes code has been 
rerun with fictitious or scrambled data sets. 

The intent is simply to provide a sense of my familiarity with various technologies
and data science techniques and packages.  

Files include: 

## Analysis
  **anova_sas.pdf** - summary of a project applying and interpreting analysis of
  variance. *(SAS)* 

  **Rfiles.R** - not actually an R script, but a series of R files that comprised portion of a study I did, applying machine learning algorithms to build classifiers to:
  * examine exit interview survey data.
  * predict when psychiatric patients would require emergency intervention services.  
  * predict when clients would experience improvement in symptoms of anxiety, depression, and psychosis.
  * predict when clients would experience a reduction in depressive symptoms, as measured by a different instrument.  
  *(R/R-Studio)*

  **exit_factors.pdf** - application of machine learning algoritms to analyze
  feature importance for why some employees leave the organization with a
  negative impression.  *(Python/Jupyter)*


## Database
  **entity_relationship_EHR.png** - example of experience with database design,
  modeling a simplified version of an Electronic Health Record.  

  **fact_dim_schema.png** - example of star schema design.  

  **mysql_oracle.sql** - examples of some basic SQL queries and DDL. *(MySQL, PLSQL)*

  **pig_hive_hbase.txt** - examples of simple queries used in academic setting when
  learning about Hadoop and applications of distributed file systems.  

## OtherLanguages
  **d_call_lib.php** - sample library of functions I wrote in PHP to support the
  implementation of a socket server designed to preserve legacy PHP code which
  communicates reporting requirements to Indiana state reporting system, called
  'DARMHA'.  *(PHP)*

  **SynchronousSocketListener.cs** - portion of socket server code, used to
  communicate with Indiana state reporting system API. *(C#/Visual Studio)*

## Visualizations
  **covid_visualizations.pdf** - handful of visualizations used to provide
  organization leadership information re: COVID spread rate and the impact on
  the organization.  *(Python/Jupyter)*  

Again, thank you for your interest in my work.
